## Traffic Sign Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
The project describes applying convolutional neural networks 
for classifying traffic sign images of the 
[German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).
Given a dataset of traffic sign images, a convolutional
neural network (with a [LeNet-5](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/) like architecture) 
is trained using [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
To speed up the training, the model is run 
on a GPU using Amazon EC2 instance.

Project details are described in more detail in the
[writeup](https://github.com/selyunin/carnd_t1_p2/blob/master/writeup.md),
implementation is available in  
[python notebook](https://github.com/selyunin/carnd_t1_p2/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb).
